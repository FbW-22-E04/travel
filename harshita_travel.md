**Jaipur** is the capital of Rajasthan and it’s a busy, bustling city which is spread out over the old and the new. 

My heart always gives a little flutter when I start to see the first glimpses of the pink city 

The old side definitely has more culture but the new also provides some of the 21st century comforts like shopping malls, bars and clubs etc.

the place i wish to travel next is : CROATIA

* With piercing turquoise seas and fairytale-like architecture, there is no denying Croatia is breathtakingly beautiful.

* Spanning most of the Adriatic Sea, you’re never too far away from the coast when traveling in Croatia. And even if it’s not pretty beaches you seek, stone castles and magnificent waterfalls await travelers of all kinds.
