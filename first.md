# Favorite travel destinations

*When I was a child, my family often took me to Irland. I love this island, the rough nature and also the mentality to celebrate together in pubs with traditional Irish music and beer ;)*

*I also enjoy to travel to the mediterranean sea, visiting places like Corsica and Creta. Lying on the beach or discover the backup area with the mountains and rivers..while enjoying wine and delicious food.*


*With my children and my partner we try to visit the Kurdish part of Turkey at least once a year where my partner's family lives. The people are so lovely and the mountains are amazing. The people have a deep connection to music and dance and they love to eat a delicious meal together.*

**I would love to visit Japan one day. I'm deeply impressed of the culture and the landscape and would like to see it with my own eyes.**
